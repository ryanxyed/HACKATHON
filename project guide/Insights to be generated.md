Basic:

1.Total revenue & orders over time — compute daily/weekly/monthly revenue, number of orders, average order value (AOV). (Time series + simple visualization)

2.Top 10 products by revenue — list product_id, product_name, total revenue, units sold.

3.Top cities by revenue — which cities contribute the most to revenue and orders?

4.Revenue by category & month — show a month × category pivot (heatmap) and identify seasonality.

5.Payment method analysis — which payment methods have the highest refund rates and average order value?

6.Repeat customer contribution — % of revenue from repeat buyers vs new buyers.

7.Average order value - Revenue / number of distinct orders.

8. Revenue by different states

9. Revenue by channel

Intermediate :
 1.	Gross vs Net revenue per month — compute both gross revenue (sum(order_value)) and net revenue after returns & refunds. Explain the assumptions you made for attribution (e.g., if return has no order_item_id, how did you match?).
 2.		Customer cohort analysis (retention) — cohort by signup month: % retained and % repeat purchasers over 3, 6, 12 months.
 3.		Revenue recognition comparison — compute monthly revenue by order/payment/delivered date and argue which is correct.
