There are three primary goals that need to be finished in a time bound manner. 

a.	Data modeling – Creating an Equivalent OLAP data model consisting of various facts and dimensions.

b.	Data ingestion & Transformation – Once the data model is created, you need to write python code to transfer data from OLTP databased into OLAP data model created by you in the dedicated schema given to you in the database. While copying the data you need to take steps to clean the data and calculate some new columns like revenue etc  

c.	Insights – You will be given business related data queries like “What is our revenue in last 24 months ?” etc. you need to derive that from the data in OLAP and present it in anyform you may like  - Graphs, sample tables, files etc

Softwares you need to have installed in your machine

1. My SQL Workbench - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ 
2. Python IDE - Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) / Jupyter Notebook (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python/files)
